## Simple demo of a rospy service that add two integers

PKG = 'test_rosservice' # this package name
NAME = 'add_two_ints_server'

# import the AddTwoInts service
from test_rosmaster.srv import *
import rospy 

def add_two_ints(req):
    print("Returning [%s + %s = %s]" % (req.a, req.b, (req.a + req.b)))
    return AddTwoIntsResponse(req.a + req.b)

def add_two_ints_server():
    rospy.init_node(NAME)
    s = rospy.Service('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts, add_two_ints)

    # spin() keeps Python from exiting until node is shutdown
    rospy.spin()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_two_ints_server()
