## Simple talker demo that listens to std_msgs/Strings published 
## to the 'chatter' topic

def listener():

    # in ROS, nodes are unique named. If two nodes with the same
    # node are launched, the previous one is kicked off. The 
    # anonymous=True flag means that rospy will choose a unique
    # name for our 'talker' node so that multiple talkers can
    # run simultaenously.
