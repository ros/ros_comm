ROSLaunch child server.

ROSLaunch has a client/server architecture for running remote
processes. When a user runs roslaunch, this creates a "parent"
roslaunch process. This parent process will then start "child"
processes on remote machines. The parent can then invoke methods on
this child process to launch remote processes, and the child can
invoke methods on the parent to provide feedback.
