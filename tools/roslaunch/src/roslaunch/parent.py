"""
roslaunch.parent providees the L{ROSLaunchParent} implementation,
which represents the main 'parent' roslaunch process. 

ROSLaunch has a client/server architecture for running remote
processes. When a user runs roslaunch, this creates a "parent"
roslaunch process, which is responsible for managing local
processes. This parent process will also start "child" processes on
remote machines. The parent can then invoke methods on this child
process to launch remote processes, and the child can invoke methods
on the parent to provide feedback.
