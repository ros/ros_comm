XML-RPC servers for parent and children

Following typical XmlRpcNode code, code is divided into:

 a) Handlers: these actually define and execute the XML-RPC API
 b) Nodes: these run the XML-RPC server

In this code you'll find 'Parent' and 'Child' code. The parent node
is the original roslaunch process. The child nodes are the child
processes it launches in order to handle remote launching (or
execution as a different user).
